# Kokutaro's Portfolio

I wanted to make a retro look design on my portfolio.

## Technologies that I used:

-   ReactJS/NextJS
-   TailwindCSS

## Getting Started

After you cloned this repo. On the CLI

`npm install` -> this will install the dependencies and hit

`npm run dev` -> the server will run on `localhost:3000`

## TODOs

-   `globals.css` should be refractored especially on the CSS grid part
-   `works` pages
-   Fix the navigation bar. It looks uneven when you see on the tabs
-   Better font
-   Animations using framer motion?
-   Responsive

## Notes
